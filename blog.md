# Introduction  
We are interested in determining the optimal location for a fancy french fry boutique. In Atlanta, there could be demand for a late-night gourmet french fry boutique to accompany the active night life. Our french fry boutique will not offer many entrees and will focus on snacks and secondarily on drinks.  
  
We expect this type of restaurant to have a number of influencing factors, even if the specific restaurant type is somewhat unique.  
* The food targets younger audiences  
* Expensive menu favors higher income area  
* Adjacency to bars and other late night attractions makes our restaurant a convenient stop in a busy night  
* Pedestrian traffic would lead to more first time customers  
  
* Fast food would detract because it provides cheaper, if lower quality, comfort food

# Data
To determine the optimal location, I used a number of data sets.  
* NPU geojson to determine crimes per region  
* Statistics of the various neighborhoods (Income, Rent, Housing, Population, Age, Transit statistics)  
* Data gathered from Foursquare containing attractions nearby each neighborhood  
* Crime data to overlay on the geojson to determine perception of safety of each neighborhood  
  
Here is the map of the crime data:
