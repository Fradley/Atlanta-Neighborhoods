Unfortunately, we were unable to generate good clusters when looked at with silhouette analysis. The solution was to refine the question to a classification problem rather than clustering. The similar venue categories were determined to be: 'Gastropub', 'Burger Joint', 'Candy Store', 'Dive Bar', 'Fish & Chips Shop', 'Fried Chicken Joint'. Notable exceptions are various cultural and fast food categories. By training a K-Nearest Neighbors model on the combined Neighborhoods and venues datasets, we could filter most of the neighborhoods. Finally, we gathered the result by assigning importance to low age, low crime, and high income."
